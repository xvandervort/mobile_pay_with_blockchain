  Fixed bug concerning failure to store amount.
  I was wrong about images not being stored. They were under ./public/system/payments/invoices/
  

3/21
  Created project.
  set up user system and transaction save form.
    Payment amount is failing to save.
    I don't think the images are being saved either.
    NEXT: Fix those 2 bugs!
  
Dev plan
  General order of development:
    Create user system  DONE
    create form for inserting images and meta information
    check form data against business rules
    return response
    Insert into blockchain.

  Home page should show recent transactions for this user and their statuses and a submit link.
  Hmmm. That argues for defaulting to transaction index instead of "home"
  NOTE: payments cannot be edited or deleted once they have been added to the blockchain.
  If user is an admin (should create admins), shows them all
